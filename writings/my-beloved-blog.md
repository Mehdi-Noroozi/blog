I've decided to own this website. When I first launched it I had the idea of owning it!.

---

This is a really short article, I just want to explain why I'm open sourcing this code. First of all, I saw a lot of interest from comments on Twitter, feel free to fork, clone, whatever this code and use it for your own blog.

Second, I thought about tidy up the code, putting it all pretty and awesome, so when people would check it they would be all like _"Holy crap! This code is sooo organized, this is so awesome!"_, screw that, seriously!

By not doing that you can see that I also write messy code, I'm mostly talking about `base.css`, but feel free to judge all the other files as well.

This can show that it's perfectly normal to write messy code, you might look at my website and think that it looks great, so clean, minimalist design, etc; But you don't know how the code looks like, well, now you can check it out.

## Now what?

I'll post here, if you're one of those persons that just like to contribute to whatever project you get your hand on, feel free to open pull requests.

If you want to use this code to build your own website, blog, etc; Go for it.
